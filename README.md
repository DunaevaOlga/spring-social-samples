This fork demonstrates spring-social-vkontakte integration.
I did changes to **spring-social-showcase** and **spring-social-showcase-xml** subprojects.

Spring Social Samples
=====================
This repository contains sample projects illustrating usage of the Spring Social project.

Samples include:
 * **spring-social-quickstart**, designed to get you up and running quickly in a Spring Framework 3.1 or > environment.
 * **spring-social-showcase**, illustrating most of the features.
 * **spring-social-showcase-sec**, a version of spring-social-showcase that uses SocialAuthenticationFilter instead of  ProviderSignInController for a tighter integration with Spring Security. 
 * **spring-social-canvas**, a variation of spring-social-quickstart that is intended to run as a Facebook Canvas application.

Some older and less maintained examples have been moved into the "attic".

<<<<<<< HEAD
**NOTE**: Previously there was a **spring-social-canvas** sample included among these samples. Although it worked, it approached the problem of authorization in a way not best suited for Facebook Canvas applications. As a result, was presenting an anti-pattern of how to develop Facebook Canvas applications with Spring Social and causing some confusion among the Spring Social community. Therefore, it has been removed for now. It will be put back once a proper canvas example is presented.

See the README in each sub directory for information on the sample and instructions on how to run the samples.
